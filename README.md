# Ligthing-Texture
This is a project created by Alejandro Sans (sansalejandro@gmail.com) and VÃ­ctor Felipe for a Computer Graphic course (Universidad Central de Venezuela). 

This projects show the ligthing and texturing integrated in Glut. ALso it shows a basic  collision with static objects when moving (w, a, s, d). It allows the user to change the ligthing effects.

# Compiling

This project requires compiling with visual studio 2015 and the following external libraries:

* [FreeGLUT] 3.0.0-2
* [AntTweakBar] 1.16
* [FreeImage] 3.17.0
* 
To compile in visual studio, the header files must be on a "tools" folder that must be created in the forlder "Tarea 5". The Header should be included as follow:

    - Tarea 5/tools/GL/ (freeglut headers)
    - Tarea 5/tools/AntTweakBar/ (AntTweakBar)
    - Tarea 5/tools/FreeImage (FreeImage)

The libraries must be on a folder "lib" that must be created in the folder "Tarea 5" as follow:
    - Tarea 5/lib

And the dll should be include on the compilation folder, in "Tarea 5"
